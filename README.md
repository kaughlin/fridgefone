# *fridgefone*

**fridgefone** is an android app that allows users to carry a virtual fridge in their pockets. Rather than the standard routine of taking a recipe and buying the ingredients to make the recipe, this app will take the ingredients the user has and generate a list of recipes the user can make with those ingredients.
